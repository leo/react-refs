Easily set references to React elements

## Caught a Bug?

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own GitHub account and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device
2. Link the package to the global module directory: `npm link`
3. Within the electron app of your choice, link it to the dependencies: `npm link react-refs`. Instead of the default one from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com), it will now use your local clone of the package!
